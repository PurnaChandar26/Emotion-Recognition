# Emotion-Recognition
Attention Detection uses Open CV that lets the user to check facial expressions of students in a classroom and obtain the output in excel sheet.
Attention Detection using Face Emotion Recognition

The Attention Detection using Face Emotion Recognition is a machine learning project that uses Python, OpenCV and a dataset of students to train a model that detects student attendance based on their emotions during a class. This project aims to provide an alternative solution to the traditional attendance-taking method that requires manual effort from the teacher.

## Requirements

Python 3.7+

OpenCV 4.2.0+

TensorFlow 2.4.0+

Pandas 1.0.5+

NumPy 1.18.5+

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of students captured during a class. Each image is labeled with the corresponding emotion of the student, such as happy, sad, or neutral. The dataset was collected using a camera placed in the classroom.

## Model Training

The machine learning model used in this project is trained using the labeled dataset. The training process involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize emotions in the images. The model is then fine-tuned to detect the level of attention of each student in the class based on their emotions.
